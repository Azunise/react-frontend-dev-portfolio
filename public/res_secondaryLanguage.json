The user has access to several restaurants to which he can give a favorite status with a heart, and for each one of the restaurant he can select different dishes to constitute his menu. It's very satisfying to replay an animation multiple times, adjusting parameters to find those that provide the most aesthetic result. In addition, the difference between different screen sizes or between a mouse click and a touch screen has to be taken into account for everyone to get a nice interface.",
